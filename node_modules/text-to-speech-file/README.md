# Text2Speech (File)

**No More Updates**: This package is not going to be updated anymore. 

Please use newer (and better) **[`NodTTS`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodtts)** package instead.

----

This is a simple NodeJS module to convert text into speech file. This module uses Google service to convert those text into file therefore, **this module depends on internet.**

**NOTE:** Due to usage of free Google Text-To-Speech API, this module can not deal with texts which are over than 200 characters. See [here for more information](https://github.com/zlargon/google-tts#limitation) 

## Usage
### Install

These are some step by step series that will get you production version of the module in your project


```sh
# add to project
yarn add text-to-speech-file

```

Those steps should add this module to your project's `node_module`.

### Usage

To use this module, simply do import and call synthesize('YOUR_SAMPLE_TEXT_HERE', 'YOUR_FILE_SAVE_PATH_HERE') function of it

```js
// importing
import ttsf from 'text-to-speech-file'
// or 
import { synthesize } from 'text-to-speech-file'

// try synthesizing text
ttsf.synthesize('hello from shrotavre!', `${__dirname}/sample-speech.mp3`)
// or 
synthesize('hello from shrotavre!', `${__dirname}/sample-speech.mp3`)

```

Those steps should produce you a sample `hello from shrotavre!` sound file.
